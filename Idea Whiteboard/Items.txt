Melee weapons - Swords, lances, axes, etc.
Ranged weapons - Bows, some variants of melee weapons (throwing spears for example), early firearms(?)
Armor variants? Unsure. Might leave this purely determined by unit class

Items should keep a fairly believable style (no comically oversized swords!), however more magically based or technologically advanced equipment can push the boundries a bit more
