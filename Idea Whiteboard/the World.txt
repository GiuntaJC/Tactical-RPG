Names are yet to be determined

Theme - Fantasy. Maybe with more modern elements? e.g. Firearms and/or some "early" versions of more advanced tech? Maybe even a faction of lost "future magic" along the lines of the Elder Scrolls' "Dwemer", or Fire Emblem Three Houses' "Agarthans"? Not too fond of the sci-fi aspects for this particular world, but still unsure.

People of the world - Anthropomorphic animals of varying species. Maybe different species tend to be parts of a few separate cultures, with some intermingling here and there. For example: A largely militaristic culture comprised of large predators such as bears and large cats, while a more technology focused culture might exist of primarily smaller creatures such as otters and more "domestic cat" styled species.
