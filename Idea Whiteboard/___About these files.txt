Any files within these folders are intended as my own sort of "whiteboard" - a place for me to write out any ideas I have, play with them and decide what I do or do not like. It will evolve as the project does, with the final game likely containing things not found here, and some ideas within these files never going beyond them and instead being scrapped the moment I read them the next day.

Do be warned that beyond the basic categories such as the world and items, the ideas here are likely to be a bit scattered. It is made for myself, however, and as such I am doing what works best for me.
