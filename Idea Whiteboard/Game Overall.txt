Tactical RPG in the same vein as Advanced Wars or Fire Emblem.

Roguelike Elements? Still debating this with myself. Makes it harder to tell a cohesive story. Helps replayability and gameplay variety, but there are other ways to accomplish this, albeit not on the same scale

Grid based movement with turn based gameplay.

Hidden attributes, map elements, units? I would like to explore better fog of war than what I've seen in others of this kind. Maybe a scout class designed specifically for gathering info?
	- Maybe different levels of f.o.w. depending on map/level? Extreme darkness or literal fog, for example.
	- Items? Telescope, "scan spell", etc.?
