# _Tactical RPG (Name WIP)_

#### _Final Capstone project for Epicodus_

#### By _**Joey Giunta**_

## Project Overview (Will be added to as the project evolves)
This is a work in progress tactical rpg started as a final project for Epicodus, but will hopefully expand beyond to be released to the world one day.
It is heavily inspired by the likes of Fire Emblem and Advance Wars, but is by no means limited to them. Ever evolving, I am still working through ideas and designs for both the game itself, and the world it is set in. So far it is planned that it will take place within a fantasy world of swords and magic inhabited by various species of anthropomorphic animals, with the player being able to customize their own character to inhabit it. I have considered adding roguelike elements to the game, however I am still going over the pros and cons in my head and have yet to make a final decision on the topic.

It is my hope that with this (admittedly ambitious) project that I can bring my life-long dream of developing video games to reality, while simultaneously having a project I can present to potential employers to show that I am worth hiring. I believe that the end result will take years to accomplish, however I intend on sticking with it to the end.

## Technologies Used or Planned (More will likely be added with time)
- C#
- .NET Core
- Unity
