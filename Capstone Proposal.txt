Name of Student: Joey Giunta
 
Name of Project: TBD - Turn based rpg for now
 
Project's Purpose or Goal: 
 
                A game with the end goal of being a mix between "Fire Emblem"-esque turn based tactical rpg and roguelike elements such as randomized maps and perks that persist after losses, it is intended to provide a new twist on 2 well known genres
 
List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 
 
                A player character with customizable stats and classes, randomized enemies and a user friendly combat system
 
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
 
                C#, Visual Studio Code, and git
 
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
 
                A grid and movement system, visuals, randomized maps, items and inventory, perks and abilities additional characters to act as either allies or bosses/minibosses
 
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
 
                Likely Unity 2d and the associated editor
 
Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
 
                I am not entirely familiar with unity or what it requires, but I know it uses c# on some level, and I have a couple of friends who have offered to show me how to use it on our free time. I will likely take them up on that offer before I start implementing anything with it. This is also a project I intend on continuing work on beyond my time at Epicodus
